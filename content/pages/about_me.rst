About Me
########

My name is Ben Hoff. This is my blog.

I graduated from the United States Air Force Academy with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, and I've been programming since 2013.

My plan for this blog is to work on several tutorials, including an `extensive PyQt tutorial`_.

My main programming language is Python. I also know C++, although I don't program it often.

I used to program live a lot. You can check out my channel_ if you'd like.

I've also published a video series on data analysis that you can purchase here_ from Packt Publishing.
