About Me
########

My name is Ben Hoff. This is my blog.

I graduated from the United States Air Force Academy with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. More recently I've been working on a master's in Computer Science. I've been programming since 2013, and have had significant amounts of experience both from a hobby and professional level with machine learning and personal assistants. 

My plan for this blog is to work on several tutorials, including an `extensive PyQt tutorial`_.

My main programming language is Python. I'm also fairly fluent in C++.

I used to program live a lot. You can check out my channel_ if you'd like.

I've published a video series on data analysis that you can purchase here_ from Packt Publishing.

Or if you want to learn some Qt, feel free to see my video series exploring the `Qt 5 framework`_.
