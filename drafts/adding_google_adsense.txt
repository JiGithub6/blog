I've already got an adsense account from the youtube account. Apparently there's some additional checks that need to go into place. I'm following the instructions here:

I just entered in my website and then looks like I have to wait? It's 4 July. Will report back later.

Just kidding, suddenly worked. I got some javascript I need to embed. Ok, looks like I need to create my own theme.

(TODO: get permenant link)

Looks like the default theme is `notmyidea`. Let's just copy it wholesale into a new default template.

# TODO: mkdir themes/default (-p?)
# cp -r venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pelican/themes/notmyidea/* themes/default

awesome. Google wants it right after the `head` tag, so we'll need to edit `base.html` and add the script there.
