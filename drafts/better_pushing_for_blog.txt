I need a better way to push the final output pages to the blog. Currently, I'm forcing the `gh-pages` overwriting the master branch of the separate repository to get around the limitations of github page's personal page limits.

I actually edited the makefile to enforce this.

I don't know much about the makefile synatax.

Current deploying uses the command `make github`

This calls the publish command, which specifys the correct publish configuration. It then commits the output directory to the gh-pages branch. Since I'm an individual instead of a user, I then force push the gh-pages branch to the actual benhoff.github.io repo.

If that all sounds hacky, that's because it is.

Although the most interesting thing to come out of it is the git syntax to push a branch to another repo.

I had to add the remote, and labeled it `publish`. I can then push using `git push -f publish gh-pages:master`

It's a weird, weird, hacky setup.
