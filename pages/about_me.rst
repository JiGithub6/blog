About Me
########

My name is Ben Hoff. This is my blog.

My plan is to work on several tutorials, including an extensive PyQt tutorial.

My main programming language is Python. I also know C++ although I don't program it often.

I used to program live a lot. You can check out my channel_ if you'd like.

I've also published a video series on data analysis that you can check purchase here_ from Packt Publishing.
